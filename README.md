# file-uploader

Simple Flask application to upload multiple files and store them locally.

## Steps to run the application

1. Clone the repo locally - `git clone https://github.com/KeaganStokoe/file-uploader.git`
2. Create a virtual environment - `python 3 -m venv venv`
3. Activate the virtual environment - `source venv/bin/activate`
4. Install Flask - `pip install flask`
5. Run the application - `python file_uploader.py`
6. Visit http://127.0.0.1:5000/ and verify that the application is running

Once completing the steps above and the application is running, you will be able to upload files, which will then be stored in a folder named `uploads` that will be created in the same directory as the project.
